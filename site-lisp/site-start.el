;; Version information

(defvar aquamacs-version "1.2"
"A string with Aquamacs' version number.
The format of the string is undefined. 
For a reliable numerical representation, use `aquamacs-version-id'.")

(defvar aquamacs-version-id 100
"A float indicating Aquamacs' version number.
Full integers correspond to the third position of the public
version number, e.g. version 0.9.7 is represented as `97.x'.
Minor version numbers are reflected in the decimals. 
It is guaranteed that for any two Aquamacs releases A and B,
if aquamacs-version-id for B is higher than aquamacs-version-id 
for A, then B is newer than A.")
