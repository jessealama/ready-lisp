Welcome to Ready Lisp!

The intention of this project to provide a fulling working Lisp environment
that's only a double-click away for Mac OS X users.

This package includes the following code items:

 - Aquamacs 1.2a
 - SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) 1.0.12
 - SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) CVS 2007-12-06
 - paredit.el
 - redshank.el
 - cldoc.el

It also includes the following documentation, all integrated with the Info
system (just press `C-h i' within Emacs to view them):

 - ANSI Common Lisp HyperSpec
 - SLIME documentation
 - ASDF documentation
 - SBCL user's manual

There are also HTML versions of all documentation, and PDF versions of most
documentation, available in these two locations:

  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/html
  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/pdf

Everthing has been pre-configured for you to enable all options and turn on
all modes.  If you wish to configure things, edit this file:

  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/init.lisp.el


NOTE to Intel users: Experimental threading has been enabled in this version
of Ready Lisp.  Also it is entirely universal, meaning it runs on PowerPC as
well as 64-bit and 32-bit Intel machines.  If you want to force it to run at
32-bit on a 64-bit machine (I find the debugging is nicer with the 32-bit
version), edit the init-lisp.el file mentioned about and change the value of
the variable `slime-use-intel-x86-64' from "t" to "nil".  Then type
`M-x byte-compile-file' to recompile init-lisp.el, and restart Ready Lisp.

Happy Lisping,
