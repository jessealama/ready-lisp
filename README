			   ========================
			    Welcome to Ready Lisp!
			   ========================

The intention of this project to provide a fulling working Lisp environment
that's only a double-click away for Mac OS X users.

This package includes the following code items:

 - Aquamacs 1.3b
 - SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) 1.0.16
 - SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) CVS 2008-04-24
 - paredit.el
 - redshank.el
 - cldoc.el

It also includes the following documentation, all integrated with the Info
system (just press `C-h i' within Emacs to view them):

 - ANSI Common Lisp HyperSpec
 - SLIME documentation
 - ASDF documentation
 - SBCL user's manual

There are also HTML versions of all documentation, and PDF versions of most
documentation, available in these two locations:

  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/html
  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/pdf

Everthing has been pre-configured for you to enable all options and turn on
all modes.  If you wish to configure things, edit this file:

  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/init.lisp.el


Happy Lisping,

NOTE: 64-bit and threading support are not enabled in Ready Lisp, because
neither of these is officially supported by SBCL on Mac OS X (yet).  If you
wish to enable them, you will have to build your own Ready Lisp from sources.
Fortunately, this process has been made quite simple for you:

  git clone git://github.com/jwiegley/ready-lisp.git
  cd ready-lisp
  make

This may take quite a while, but eventually it will leave a .dmg file in an
"image" sub-directory.

To build with 64-bit Intel support:

  make ARCH=x86_64

To build with threading enabled:

  make THREADING=yes

To build a universal binary, assuming you have ssh access to a PowerPC box
named "ppcbox":

  make PPC_HOST=ppcbox

If you wish to update any of the sub-packages to newer versions, edit the
Makefile to select the version(s) you want, run "git checkout <TAG>" within
sbcl to select a release tag, and finally run "make clean", followed by
another "make".
