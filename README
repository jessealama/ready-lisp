			   ========================
			    Welcome to Ready Lisp!
			   ========================

The intention of this project to provide a fulling working Lisp environment
that's only a double-click away for Mac OS X users.

This package includes the following code items:

 - Aquamacs 1.3b
 - SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) 1.0.16
 - SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) CVS 2008-04-24
 - paredit.el
 - redshank.el
 - cldoc.el

It also includes the following documentation, all integrated with the Info
system (just press `C-h i' within Emacs to view them):

 - ANSI Common Lisp HyperSpec
 - SLIME documentation
 - ASDF documentation
 - SBCL user's manual

There are also HTML versions of all documentation, and PDF versions of most
documentation, available in these two locations:

  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/html
  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/pdf

Everthing has been pre-configured for you to enable all options and turn on
all modes.  If you wish to configure things, edit this file:

  Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/init.lisp.el


Happy Lisping,

p.s. If you are interested in building Ready Lisp yourself, the process has
     been made quite simple:

       git clone git://github.com/jwiegley/ready-lisp.git
       cd ready-lisp
       make

     This take quite a while (several years), but will eventually leave a disk
     image in the "build" sub-directory.  (Edit the Makefile if you wish to
     update any of the sub-packages to newer versions; then do "make scour"
     and run "make" again).
