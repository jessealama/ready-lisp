The files in this directory are used for building the Ready Lisp disk image
(ReadyLisp.dmg).

If any of the component versions are updated, then Background.graffle should
be edited (with OmniGraffle), and the resulting image re-exported.  Here are
the steps that I use:

 1. Open Background.graffle with OmniGraffle.  It was created with
    OmniGraffle Professional 5.

 2. Edit the version numbers as needed.

 3. Make sure nothing is selected.

 4. Choose menu option: File | Export... (Cmd-Opt-E)

 5. Export the image to "dist/image.png" with the following settings:

    First, uncheck everything.

    Format:             PNG bitmap image
    Scale:              100%
    Bitmap Resolution:  72 dots per inch

 6. Once the file is saved, you can exit OmniGraffle.  Nothing more
    needs to be done except to run "make", or "make disk-image" if you
    already did a make but then realized you forgot to update the
    background image (it happens!).
